The simulator has two parts, the simulation part and the replay part. You add your player class to the simulator by editing the players.txt file in player folder (the same way as project 2) and run the simulation starting at MirrorUniverse.java. The simulation will generate a replay file in the folder of replays which records the history as well as the config of the game. Then you run MUGUI.java which launches the GUI we saw in the class. Choose manual/replay mode, then load the replay file by clicking "Load" button. One feature I added after class is the "Fog", which will hide the area you haven't visited yet to give you a more consistent feeling as the player you are going to code. You can switch the fog on and off by clicking the Fog check box.

To config a game, go to game/games.txt file. This file has two lines of configurations corresponding to left and right map, respectively. The first two parameters are the size of the map, the third parameter is the sight radius. The fourth parameter is a non-negative integer random seed for generating a random map. Fixing the size and the seed, you fix the map. Or you can pick a negative integer to use a user assigned map. If it is random map, then the fifth parameter is the probability of an obstacle at each location, the higher this value is, the more obstacles you have. If you choose appointed map, then put the path as the fifth parameter. The sixth parameter is for random map only, which is a random seed to generate the player position as well as the exit.

To make a map, put a map file in folder maps. I mentioned the format briefly in the lecture. However, after the class, I change exit to number 2 and player position to 3 to make the map file better aligned.
